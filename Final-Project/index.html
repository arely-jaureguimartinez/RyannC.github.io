     <h2> Background </h2>

    <p> Gastritis is inflammation of the stomach lining. It
    can have many different causes. The disease can be <br>
     an acute or chronic that increases the risk of other
      conditions, such as ulcers, stomach, or cancer,due to several
      reasons, the most common being the colonization of Helicobacter
      Pylori (hell-i-co-bacter pie-loree). Other factors that lead to
gastritis are excessive alcohol use, constant and long lasting
vomiting, stress, or the use of certain medications, like anti-inflammatory
 drugs. This disease mostly infects those who have colonization of h.pylori
  in the mucus of their stomach lining, which eventually form ulcers. It is
   relevant to know about this bacterial infection because if it is left
   untreated, it could turn much more severe/chronic. The unusual part of
    this disease is that people could have the bacteria or infection present,
    without symptoms, which is concerning because it could worsen their current
    stage of gastritis wether it is in the beginning or late stages.

 <h2> Why Should I know about Gastritis</h2>
      <p> We want people to be aware of gastritis and of the places it<br>
         impacts because they could be a part of the cycle. The good news<br>
        is that like most cycles, it can break. Gastritis usually infects <br>
        people living in lower socioeconomic communities, where they have<br>
         less access to food that does not have h.pylori. This is most<br>
         commonly seen in developing countries and it is rarely talked about,<br>
       as not many people are aware of gastritis, and other stomach related <br>
       disorders.
