    <h2> Overview </h2>


<p> <b>Gastritis</b> is inflammation of the stomach lining. It
  can have many different causes. The disease can be <br>
   an acute or chronic that increases the risk of other
    conditions, such as ulcers, stomach, or cancer,due to several
    reasons, the most common being the colonization of Helicobacter
    Pylori (hell-i-co-bacter pie-loree). Other factors that lead to
gastritis are excessive alcohol use, constant and long lasting
vomiting, stress, or the use of certain medications, like anti-inflammatory
drugs. This disease mostly infects those who have colonization of h.pylori
in the mucus of their stomach lining, which eventually form ulcers. It is
 relevant to know about this bacterial infection because if it is left
 untreated, it could turn much more severe/chronic. The unusual part of
  this disease is that people could have the bacteria or infection present,
  without symptoms, which is concerning because it could worsen their current
  stage of gastritis wether it is in the beginning or late stages.

     <h2> Why Should I know about Gastritis?</h2>
    <p> We want people to be aware of gastritis and of the places it<br>
       impacts because they could be a part of the cycle. The good news<br>
      is that like most cycles, it can break. Gastritis usually infects <br>
      people living in lower socioeconomic communities, where they have<br>
       less access to food that does not have h.pylori. This is most<br>
       commonly seen in developing countries and it is rarely talked about,<br>
     as not many people are aware of gastritis, and other stomach related <br>
     disorders.<br><br>

    <p> Formal Interview Response: According to a call I had with Dr.Moss a
   professor of Brown University( who wrote an article on h.pylori, and
   gastritis, for research purposes) he confirmed that “gastritis is definitely
   a topic that should be discussed about depending on the priority/community.”
  He also said that early detection of h.pylori is very crucial, as it could lead
  to infections such as gastritis, which lead to stomach/gastric cancer. To
   battle it, antibiotics are being used.
  Another important point that Mr. Moss poimted out is that it is in fact true,
 that developing countries, and lower socioeconmic groups of color have higher
 rates of h.pylori. He encourages people to learn about it on time, so that it
      doesn’t worsen.</p>
