      <p> Gastritis is inflammation of the stomach lining. It
    can have many different causes. The disease can be <br>
     an acute or chronic that increases the risk of other
      conditions, such as ulcers, stomach, or cancer,due to several
      reasons, the most common being the colonization of Helicobacter
      Pylori (hell-i-co-bacter pie-loree). Other factors that lead to
gastritis are excessive alcohol use, constant and long lasting
vomiting, stress, or the use of certain medications, like anti-inflammatory
 drugs. This disease mostly infects those who have colonization of h.pylori
  in the mucus of their stomach lining, which eventually form ulcers. It is
   relevant to know about this bacterial infection because if it is left
   untreated, it could turn much more severe/chronic. The unusual part of
    this disease is that people could have the bacteria or infection present,
    without symptoms, which is concerning because it could worsen their current
    stage of gastritis wether it is in the beginning or late stages.
 </p>  
      
      
    <h2> Symptoms </h2>
    <p> The signs and symptoms of gastritis: </p>
    <li> Nausea </li>
    <li> Abdominal Pain </li>
    <li> Vomiting </li>
    <li> Indigestion </li>
    <li> Burning Sensation in the Stomach </li>
    <li> Loss of Appetite </li>
    <li> Hiccups </li>
    <li> Belching </li>

    <h2> Causes </h2>
    <p> Weakness in your stomach lining allows digestive juices to damage and inflame it, causing gastritis. </p>
    <p> Risk Factors That Cause Gastritis: </p>
    <li> Extreme Alcohol Consumption </li>
    <li> Drug Use </li>
    <li> Tobacco Use </li>
    <li> Autoimmune Disorders </li>
    <li> Stress </li>
    <li> Bile Flowing Into the Stomach </li>
    <li> Long-Term Use of Certain Medications </li>
    <li> Age </li>

    <h2> Types of Gastritis </h2>
    <p> Several types of chronic gastritis exist, and they are caused by different things:
      <li>Type A: Casued by immune system destroying stomach cells. Can increase risk of anemia and cancer. </li>
      <li>Type B: The most common type, is caused by Helicobacter pylori bacteria, and can cause ulcers (stomach and intestinal). </li>
      <li>Type C: Caused by chemical irritants like anti-inflammatory drugs, alcohol, and bile. It can also cause stomach lining erosion and bleeding. </li>

       <h2> Why Should I know about Gastritis?</h2>
      <p> We want people to be aware of gastritis and of the places it<br>
         impacts because they could be a part of the cycle. The good news<br>
        is that like most cycles, it can break. Gastritis usually infects <br>
        people living in lower socioeconomic communities, where they have<br>
         less access to food that does not have h.pylori. This is most<br>
         commonly seen in developing countries and it is rarely talked about,<br>
       as not many people are aware of gastritis, and other stomach related <br>
       disorders.<br><br>
       Formal Interview Response: According to a call I had with Dr.Moss a
     professor of Brown University( who wrote an article on h.pylori, and
     gastritis, for research purposes) he confirmed that “gastritis is definitely
     a topic that should be discussed about depending on the priority/community.”
    He also said that early detection of h.pylori is very crucial, as it could lead
    to infections such as gastritis, which lead to stomach/gastric cancer. To
     battle it, antibiotics are being used.
    Another important point that Mr. Moss poimted out is that it is in fact true, 
   that developing countries, and lower socioeconmic groups of color have higher
   rates of h.pylori. He encourages people to learn about it on time, so that it
        doesn’t worsen.</p>

      
      
      
    <h2> Statistics/Data </h2>
    <p> An estimated 50% of the world population is infected with H Pylori, and infection which leads to 
      the greater majority of Gastritis cases.</p>
